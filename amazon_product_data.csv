"Noise Twist Bluetooth Calling Smart Watch with 1.38"" TFT Biggest Display, Up-to 7 Days Battery, 100+ Watch Faces, IP68, Heart Rate Monitor, Sleep Tracking (Jet Black)",Electronics,,"₹1,499.00","I gifted this watch to one of my cousins who is still in college. It was his selection, so I consider this watch as a Millennial choice. The band is sleek, and the dial looks good on young people. Features-wise, I could not explore much due to limited access. However, not hearing anything negative about it from my teenage cousin makes it seem like a good choice, right?

It is a good-for-money deal. Just work on the software to add a setting when connected along with Bluetooth earphones & received calls via watch the mic & sound be from earphones not from the watch. and if nothing is connected then it's fine.

The product looks excellent and friendly but its response to the handshake seems to be slow

                            Overall the look and feel of the watch is superb. The sensors are functioning properly. However, they are not accurate every time.
                            

                            We can store only one watch face apart from the four watch faces which comes pre installed. It should have more than 5 watches faces to store which is a let down in this watch…rest every thing is manageable and good.
                            

                            WhatsApp notifications are not showing up even though it enabled. I don’t know if I’m the one who is facing this issue. Have to figure it out to fix this issue.
                            

                            The watch got delivered on 10th June 2023, and in 5 days of usage the battery level was pretty decent from 100% to it went down to 15%.
                            

                            Bought it for Rs 1499/- and it’s a good buy for daily usage in this budget range.
