      "Summary for Row 1: I have played the game Chrono Cross but out of all of the games I have ever played it has the best music! It paints the senery in your mind so well I would recomend it even to people who hate vid. It backs away from crude keyboarding and takes a fresher step with grate guitars and soulful orchestras.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 2: The music is timeless and I'm been listening to it for years now and its beauty simply refuses to fade.The price tag on this is pretty staggering I must say, but if you are going to buy any cd for this much money, this is the only one that I feel would be worth every penny. : I'm reading a lot of reviews saying that this is the best 'game soundtrack' and I figured that I'd write a review to disagree a bit. The best soundtrack ever to anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 3: The higher energy tracks like \"Chrono Cross ~ Time's Scar~\", \"Time of the Dreamwatch\", and \"Chronomantique\" (indefinably remeniscent of Chrono Trigger) are all absolutely superb as well.This soundtrack is amazing music, probably the best of this composer's work (I haven't heard the Xenogears soundtrack, so I can't say for sure), and even if you've never played the game, it would be worth twice the price to buy it.I wish I could give it 6 stars. The intense sadness of \"Prisoners of Fate\" (which means all the more if you've played the game) and the hope in \"A Distant Promise\" and \"Girl who Stole the Star\" have been an important inspiration to me personally throughout my teen years. : This soundtrack is my favorite music of all time, hands down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 4: Garden Of God, Chronopolis, Fates, Jellyfish sea, Burning Orphange, Dragon's Prayer, Tower Of Stars, Dragon God, and Radical Dreamers - Unstealable Jewel.Overall, this is a excellent soundtrack and should be brought by those that like video game music.Xander Cross my favorites are Scars Of Time, Between Life and Death, Forest Of Illusion, Fortress of Ancient Dragons, Lost Fragment, and Drowned Valley.Disk Two: The Draggons, Galdorb - Home, Chronomantique, Prisoners of Fate, Gale, and my girlfriend likes ZelbessDisk Three: The best of the three. Excellent Soundtrack: I truly like this soundtrack and I enjoy video game music.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 5: The greatest songs are without a doubt, Chrono Cross: Time's Scar, Magical Dreamers: The Wind, The Stars, and the Sea and Radical Dreamers: Unstolen Jewel. Remember, Pull Your Jaw Off The Floor After Hearing it: If you've played the game, you know how divine the music is! Every single song tells a story of the game, it's that good!\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6: It has everything for every listener -- from fast-paced and energetic (Dancing the Tokage or Termina Home), to slower and more haunting (Dragon God), to purely beautifully composed (Time's Scar), to even some fantastic vocals (Radical Dreamers).This is one of the best videogame soundtracks out there, and surely Mitsuda's best ever. And whether you were aware of it or not, Mitsuda's music contributed greatly to the mood of every single minute of the whole game.Composed of 3 CDs and quite a few songs (I haven't an exact count), all of which are heart-rendering and impressively remarkable, this soundtrack is one I assure you you will not forget. an absolute masterpiece: I am quite sure any of you actually taking the time to read this have played the game at least once, and heard at least a few of the tracks here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 7: I can't imagine anyone reading the whole thing--I spent an evening with the book and a friend and we were in hysterics reading bits and pieces of it to one another. Maybe I can offer them my 8th grade term paper on \"To Kill a Mockingbird\"--a book I am quite sure Ms. Haddon never heard of. Anyway, unless you are in a mood to send a book to someone as a joke---stay far, far away from this one!\n",

      "Summary for Row 8: Not reading this book is a crime, becuase you are missing out on a heart warming story. The story was amazing and I was pleasantly surprised at the changes in the book. I am not normaly someone who is into romance novels, but the world was raving about this book and so I bought it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 9: I expected an average romance read, but instead I found one of my favorite books of all time. The writting was so descriptive that my heart broke when Julia's did and I felt as if I was there with them instead of just a distant reader. A FIVE STAR BOOK: I just finished reading Whisper of the Wicked saints.\n",

      "Summary for Row 10: Whispers of the Wicked Saints: This was a easy to read book that made me want to keep reading on and on, not easy to put down.It left me wanting to read the follow on, which I hope is coming soon. This book made me want to read again. I used to read a lot but have gotten away from it.\n",

This book makes you fall in love and can heat you up,it can also make you so angery.\n",

      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 14: I figured I was in trouble when a typo is prominently featured on the back cover, but the first page of the book removed all doubt. Oh please: I guess you have to be a romance novel lover for this one, and not a very discerning one. This has to be an intentional churning of over-heated prose for satiric purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 15: I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot, that I decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling. This book seems to have been written by a 7th grader with poor grammatical skills for her age! As another reviewer points out, there is a misspelling on the cover, and I believe there is at least one per chapter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 16: : It's glaringly obvious that all of the glowing reviews have been written by the same person, perhaps the author herself. Don't try to fool us with fake reviews. They all have the same misspellings and poor sentence structure that is featured in the book.\n",

      "Summary for Row 17: This is a very cool story about a young Cuban girl searching for idenity who stumbles into a coastal resort kitchen gig with a zen motorcycle maintenance man, three hysterical Italian chefs and a Latino fireballing right handed pitcher who plays on the team sponsored by the resort's owner. A romantic zen baseball comedy: When you hear folks say that they don't make 'em like that anymore, they might be talking about \"BY THE SEA\". As is often the case she 'finds' herself through honest, often comical but always emotional, interaction with this sizzling roster of players.\n",

      "Summary for Row 18: Even though my blood clot has been gone for 4 years, I still buy these to wear as support stockings because they make my legs feel so nice. I bought an inexpensive garter belt and it works fine and helps keep the stockings from rolling. : After I had a DVT my doctor required me to wear compression stockings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 19: Also, as the day wears on, they begin to roll down from the top and create a very deep ridge in the skin. I feel like I've had a full day workout after getting them on. I have to wear them, so if those two difficulties could be addressed it would be such a help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 20: sizes recomended in the size chart are not real: sizes are much smaller than what is recomended in the chart. I guess you should not buy this item in the internet..it is better to go to the store and check it I tried to put it and sheer it!.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 21: mens ultrasheer: This model may be ok for sedentary types, but I'm active and get around alot in my job - consistently found these stockings rolled up down by my ankles! Solution: go with the standard compression stocking, 20-30, stock #114622. Both pair of these also tore as I struggled to pull them up all the time.\n",

      "Summary for Row 22: But no, it is cookie MIX and I guess I should have noticed that since it is right in the title.This is the first time I have ever tried baking with a cookie mix. However, with a cookie mix like this you have a lot of flexibility in the ratio of ingredients (I like to add some extra butter to make the baked cookies more chewy). Delicious cookie mix: I thought it was funny that I bought this product without knowing it was a mix.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 23: Probably the cue should have been the packaging is straight out of your street corner bootleg dealer.If you've ever seen a reasonably good condition film copy, you know the defining visuals of his film are the crystal clear lighting contrasts in black and white. The surrounding countryside and 'old home' scenes are set with early morning ground mists or the haze of memory while the events on the bridge and in the water are bright, clear, and immediate.Here everything is dull, dark, and clouded. Another Abysmal Digital Copy: Rather than scratches and insect droppings, this one has random pixelations combined with muddy light and vague image resolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 24: I don't know of any other book that looks at Japanese society from the point of view of its young people poised as they are between their parents' age-old Japanese culture of restraint and obedience to the will of the community, and their peers' adulation of Western culture. True to form, the \"New Young\" of Japan seem to be creating an \"international\" blend, as the Ando family demonstrates in this beautifully written book of vignettes of the private lives of members of this family. Steven Wardell is clearly a talented young author, adopted for some of his schooling into this family of four teens, and thus able to view family life in Japan from the inside out.\n",

      "Summary for Row 25: i liked this album more then i thought i would: I heard a song or two and thought same o same o,but when i listened to songs like \"blue angel\",\"lanna\" and 'mama\" the hair just rose off my neck.Roy is trully an amazing singer with a talent you don't find much now days.\n",

      "Summary for Row 26: It charges AA batteries just fine, but has a huge problem securing smaller AAA batteries. In the beginning one of the four AAA batteries would pop up, and now three out of the four won't hold. The problem is the flip mechanism became loose, and any horizontal pressure would push the buttons back up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 27: Works, but not as advertised: I bought one of these chargers..the instructions say the lights stay on while the battery charges...true. I just kept it since it does charge...but the lights are useless since they seem to always stay on. The instructions doNT say the lights turn off when its done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 28: I now have to go and find batteries that will give me longer life than the kodak NiMH AA batteries. The charger is convenient by charging all four batteries at once but the charge only lasts a very short time. Disappointed: I read the reviews,made my purchase and was very disappointed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 29: Oh dear: I was excited to find a book ostensibly about Muslim feminism, but this volume did not live up to the expectations.One essay, among other things, describes the veil as potentially liberating. It doesn't begin to explain how or why.Another, on Muslim women in Cape Town, claims that Muslim women there are separate but \"more than equal.\" Gee whiz, what a disappointment.I had expected and hoped for at least one Muslim feminist condemnation of gender apartheid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 30: It's a bit awkward to work the whole TV/VHS/DVD selection options but I think I've gotten the hang of it.Two comments: it's not intuitive and actually is pretty complicated (too many buttons on the remote but that might please others who are more technically-minded than me) so I've had to rely heavily on the how-to manual. And setting the VCR timer is awkward -- you can't enter the start and end time but have to scroll (unless I'm missing something)...but those are my only complaints. : This VCR/DVD was an early Christmas present to myself after deciding to join the rest of the world in DVD-land but not wanting to let go of my VHS movies quite yet.\n",

I bought one anyway (new) and must say I am not happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 32: I like my combo player except for 2 things:(1)no cable box compatability on the remote control (2)no seperate audio video inputs only input for coax cable from my cable box so all of the cable programming is in mono...wife can't tell the difference in the sound so if she's happy then I'll just live with it. happy with it...but: I'm a JVC nut...I have 3 JVC televisions, one VCR, one bookshelf audio system and car audio system.

      "Summary for Row 33: should be titled \"Hollywood Debacle\": The plot is so ridiculous, I have to wonder if they even read the script before making this film. The mountain lion breaks out of his trailer - and the cars behind don't notice? The mountain lion is captured - and put in a jail cell?\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 34: The reason...Hotel was set at a fictional San Francisco hotel as Hotel Babylon was set at a luxury five-star hotel in England.I recommend this DVD to anyone who is willing to watch a great show from the BBC. The show could make for a great drama series, but I felt that it is a mix of a drama, comedy, and soap opera all mixed into a great BBC show. The show features some incredible acting from Tamzin Outhwaite (formerly of EastEnders, a BBC soap) and Max Beesley (from the ill-fated movie \"Glitter\" starring Mariah Carey).\n",

      "Summary for Row 37: This is a great time for anyone who is disgusted with the boorish state of American media, politics and discourse in general, to clear their heads for the substantial challenges that lie before us not only as Americans, but as human beings. This book is a lucid, well argued explanation of the simple fact that we have become so totally focused on our individual RIGHTS that we have completely ignored, and even mocked, our personal and public responsibilities. Rochelle explains It All for You: Wondering what the hell has happened to the moral aspect of modern American culture ?\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 38: More great playing: Larry's work for the Muse label in the late 80s and early 90s found him exploring the rich catalog of jazz standards that he probably grew up playing. Listen to Larry's take on \"My Funny Valentine\" and tell me it doesn't stand right up there with Chet Baker's or Miles'. Surrounding himself with the best musicians around, Larry sounds relaxed, focused, and totally in control.\n",

      "Summary for Row 40: You are not able to use the mouse through any of the games except for the \"power-up segments\" instead you are using the up-down arrows on the keyboard - too hard for him and not much fun. Very Frustrating: My three year old son was very excited to get this but after two attempts at playing it hasn't been touched since. Very disapointed with this game and wish I could return it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 41: Mind numbing: This game makes you do the same things over and over, it never holds my son's attention long enough to get to the next level. We have another Rescue Heroes game and both my boys 3 and 6 love it, but this one is a dog! There is no choice of games you have to do every thing in order.\n",

The only thing that worked reliably was the pancakes recipe, but that can be found other places as well.If you are looking for reliable recipes and concise information about starting a sourdough and maintaining it, I recommend any of Ed Wood's books, even his very old ones. Lisa Rayner has written a fabulous tome in Wild Bread.\n",

If it were, it would also be my last.Normally, I can forgive Higgins his cliche's and his obsessive attention to his characters' drinking habits, because his characters are fun and interesting.

Gripping: This novel is an Opera, pure and simple.Granted it is not the easiest novel to read, and Hawthorne can be slightly repetitive with the metaphors, similes and analogies that sometimes go on for several lines.

As an experienced pianist and professional classical musician, I think I can safely say that these master composers would have GLADLY accepted Hawtin into their inner circle, if not for the plethora of distinct, yet related sounds, then for the complexity of the underlying formal structure that holds the entire soundscape together. This is really something special....: I've been studying music in the classical realm for a long time, but have always been interested in electronic music in both performance and composition.

EXCELLENT: Eddie Palmieri, like most early-1970s jazz players, must have known popular music had taken over the world and caught the bug.Whether he wanted to make money or just expand his horizons, it really doesn't matter.He formed this band, Harlem River Drive, in 1970, and made one hell of an album.

And her inability to get outside of her own head/her own life was not terribly interesting to read.For someone who always longed to be a 'star,' I am sure publishing a book was quite a thrill for her. I was very disappointed in this book: I was expecting to read a book about the Amish.\n",

The production from Harris Johns is top-notch and most of the songs are truly great, only a few descending into that mindless drum-pounding/guitar-shredding that can sometimes afflict bands that straddle the line between thrash and death or black metal.

You can hide your troops, you can stay higher than the enemy and then attack you enemy suddenly (for example,if your bowmen are in a higher position they will hurt more seriously the enemy).

This book isn't really about the \"Mothman\" sightings in West Virginia as much as it is a goofy memoir of John Keel's \"research\" into the world of UFOs, demons, ghosts, and other bizarre events.

Brilliant, Lagwagon's most \"complex\" album: The CD will not grab you at first, its not as catchy as Lagwagon's previous releases, but with a few listens it makes the argument for greatest Lag album ever. The CD is dedicated to Derrick (the bands original drummer) and with that comes a lot of emotion, dealing a lot with reflection, moving on, and self-discovery, the lyrics here are very well crafted.\n",

In contrast to most readers pre conceived notions where the `sadism' part of BDSM lifestyle is usually a description of a master beating the living daylights out of his slave, Maria Isabel Pita describes her relationship with her master as a pretty well wholesome practice of living out her fantasies ......Yes there are rules and considerations to a good relationship and the results can only be understated as very very satisfying.

Any girl who needs to prover her worth and devotion by degrading any and all around her isn't creating a deeper bond of submission, but pathetically wallowing in a misplaced sense of value (with a heaping side of self-image issues). : Technically this was an exercise in tautology, and albeit the author admits that they are events not presented chronologically/linerally, the whole thing came off as a repetitive scrapbook of free associative ramblings.\n",

However, the remaining tracks offer enjoyable examples of the Hollies vocal and musical expertise.In addition to the aforementioned AIR, I like the airy mystique of PICK UP THE PIECES, the harmonic rock of IT'S A SHAME IT'S A GAME, TRANSATLANTIC WESTBOUND JET, and DON'T LET ME DOWN. Ballad-wise, DON'T LET ME DOWN is sharp and the 50ish doo-wop sound of LOVE MAKES THE WORLD GO ROUND is a nice change of pace.Overall, an enjoyableslice of 70s pop.\n",

Granted people's experiences differ from prefecture to prefecture and from school to school, but Learning to Bow's anecdotes and observations about Japan are far too extreme and at times border on lies.

Ok, I know its Prague and 1968 and the whole Russian-thing, but come on - the historical backdrop was handled way too superficially.

Now I think they wanted the girls in the class to see it on their own, because they may have wanted to discuss it with them personally after the class was dismissed, if you catch my drift.I would pass on this one-big time.

Read the book - it takes less time!\n",

      "Summary for Row 2731: I doubt anybody, based on the movie only, would be able to understand what happend in 1968 in the Czech republic and what was the consequence for the entire society. Kundera was right to object: The movie doesn't at all reflect the original book story in its core concept. If I didn't read the book before I wouldn't be able to guess what is the movie trying to explain.\n",

His love for the woman, too, has been put to the test, yet he sticks with her, even though it means returning to his country after being given exile in France.The themes are intelligent and interesting, but the development is too slow: the movie is much too long at nearly 3 hours. Scenes seemed to be dragged out interminably, especially those in Paris as he weighs his conscience regarding his love and his homeland, and near the end on the farm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 2733: The best film nobody saw: The Unbearable Lightness of Being is a masterpiece, the most underrated American film of the past 30 years. If this all sounds very somber, ULOB is also one of the sexiest films you will ever see, and one of the few intelligent studies of sex in cinema. While idealizing the free-wheeling Prague of the late 60's the film also examines the emptiness of such a non-commital lifestyle- the unbearable lightness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 2734: A wispy shadow of Kundera's book...: Making my comparison to Milan Kundera's book, I have to rate this movie fairly low. I don't believe Kaufman was able to capture the essence of Kundera's writing with this film representation. So much of Kundera's writing is internal to the characters, which is difficult (at best) to communicate on screen.\n",

(The toppling building sequence impressed me tremendously),and the cast stays on point to where there are no weak links.Some credit has to be given to Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as Sam Witwicky's(Shia LaBeouf)girlfriend,who is actually alot more tolerable than Megan Fox.Long story short,I wish I had gone to go see this one,as it proves that Michael Bay is still fully capable at keeping our attention with off the wall action spectacles.Keep up the good work.

This would be excusable if the protagonists were interesting.Go read Jack Vance or Gene Wolfe if you want masterful sci-fi!\n",

The characters don't seem to really reach me the way they should, but one has to bear in mind that this book is actually a collection of shorter stories published in serial format, and the writer could not be bothered too much with deep character development.

Reading this book was similar to being on the receiving end of a self-absorbed bore's monologue at a cocktail party, absent the cocktails and the party.The book is less about Claude Harmon, Sr. and more about Butch Harmon, Jr. and how he \"got his life together.\" From cover to cover it rings with false modesty, and rationalization of a self-righteous, bullying bravado.My brand new copy did not find its place on the bookshelf with Bobby Jones, Dave Pelz, Jack Nicklaus, and many others.\n",

Over half of this book came across as a particularly long and pointless conversation between a dullard and his favorite stuffed animal.Overall, I wish I'd had a review that had warned me thusly:(last line of the review) And I picked up this book hoping it would become one of my favorites.The fact is, I didn't find much in this book that was funny.This novel moves along at a snail's pace, in terms of the plot and the humor.\n",

Although it did have a few good parts to it, this book was a novel that seemed to drag on and on.When Ivan and September get left alone at their small remote home on the shores of Alaska, 12 year old Ivan messes up the raidos.

Good book for young teens: Ok, the kids accused me of reading it because its full of boats, dories, fishing boats, rowboats, skiffs, mailboats etc and they are right. So there are dead people mentioned in the book, a dead mother, but she's long gone by the time the story starts.Anyway I liked it.\n",

After he was bulldozed into joining the family dance-music business, engineer-trained Josef (1827-1870) proved to be the most industrious of all the Strauss family during the remainder of his short life. I reckon, having collected and listened to all the volumes so far issued in this Marco Polo Josef Strauss Edition, that inspiration and innovation did not always keep up with his gruelling work schedule.\n",

I agree that the account of the aftermath was drawn out and took away from the description of the crime itself, but I can appreciate the relief that came from sharing that experience.A couple of weeks after reading the book I had a chance encounter with Jeanine and Tom Cummins' mother - it was a complete coincidence that I came to realize who she was.

The newspaper articles, and TV interviews in St Louis were mainly focused on Tom's (the cousin) guilt, and these \"mystery 4 men\".

      "Summary for Row 6014: I really thought there would be actual scenes of a birth (i.e., a birth film as you would see in a real life class), and real graphics (instead of zooming in on the sign the instructor is holding up! I had my tv almost on max volume just to hear.The information is ok, but several years old and new studies are showing controlled breathing beats all the patterned breathing that is taught here. Why is it presented as a badly shot (often shaky camera work) montage of a lady talking to a birthing class?\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6015: Also, I bought this because I was having my first child and didn't know what to expect during labor but once you go into labor the nurses tell you everything to do so the video was a total waste. Don't waste your money: I did not enjoy this video or find it informative. I thought the video was very boring and only watched half of it before I tossed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6016: The women in the video seem uninterested with what was going on and the video as a whole felt very out of date. not worth the money: i felt like i was being talked down to the whole time. Me and my wife found this video to be a waste of money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6017: Needless to say, if you are the type of person who must have audio and visual to learn, steer clear of this and find an instructional video that's more concise. : This video was dull and did not provide any information that I didn't already read in the books that I checked out from the public library for free. If you like long winded stories and have too much free time on your hands, this might be the video for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6018: Sheri thinks she is funny when she talks in a screeching voice and makes fun of new mother's foibles in her \"funny stories\". But unfortuanately Sheri spends more time talking or shrieking while trying to be amusing than just giving the information you would like to hear. Way too annoying: I'm sure the information presented in this class is good, but the presentation set my teeth on edge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6019: And, she really must hate women in labor, judging by the way she makes fun of them and mimics them with a whiney, high-pitched baby voice. Throughout the whole \"pushing\" section she talks about how much you will whine, and if you don't, just wait because you must not really be in labor yet. If she was my L&D nurse, I would cross my legs until the next shift change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6020: Take the time and go to the casses: This DVD was over rated and to be honest, as a first time mother, I found watching this video in my 6 & 7 month to be nerve racking and at times scary. The classes were informative, I received more info there along with some freebeees. Go to the classes offered at your hospital.\n",

      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6022: : My husband and I didn't have time to attend an 8 hour birthing class at the hospital, so we opted for this video. It was very informative and helped us understand what was happening when we went to the hospital. It was a little cheesy, but definitely worth getting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6023: great alternative to going to a class: My husband and I felt prepared enough after watching this DVD. Sometimes the teacher's sense of humor was annoying BUT I learned A LOT from her. (Though she's also clearly pro-natural birthing)\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6024: I really wanted to learn from the video but the dumb jokes and Sheri trying so hard to make it funny just makes it tough to watch. However, I feel like I am watching an episode of Family Guy when they stretch a joke way past the funny part. She is trying so hard to be funny that she ruins the purpose of the video.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6025: I watched it once and the second time I watched it I took notes. I maye even watch it one more time before my baby is born this July. : I really didn't want to take Lamaze classes, just not my thing.\n",

      "Summary for Row 6026: Learn About Birth at Home: Convenient, Easy: Love it!This DVD includes real couples in classes by Shirley (who is teaching the classes)In a nutshell she walks you through women anatomy, birth (or labor signs), do's and dont's; breathing exercises, and labor.Because each sections is separated in chapters, you can choose which ones to view; The best part is to be able to view this in the comfort of your home with your partner or husband, at your convenience; ask questions to you doctor or midwife as well.\n",

      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6029: Very educational: This DVD has good information, but the woman is annoying. It is a good alternative to going to a birthing class. I think they could have shortened it up a little bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6030: Great for 1st Time Parents: My husband works shift work so it was extremely hard for us to attend lamaze classes, but this video made us feel so comfortable in our own home. We can always refer back to it if we need a refresher course. The breathing technique and education was on point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6031: Worth it: My husband and I were not able to attend a birthing class, so the doctor suggested we rent/buy a video. We decided on this one, and although the 'teacher' was a bit corny it was helpful. I especially liked that you could fast forward and skip parts!\n",

      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6033: Reasonable prep for chldbirth: I bought this to prep myself and my husband for the natural (midwife attended) birth of our second child. However I do not agree with everything that is \"taught\" on this video; I guess that's why we chose a midwife instead of a doctor/hosptal for this birth. If you buy this video (or get it from the local library) make sure you take what is said with a grain of salt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6034: The video is frankly quite boring.Search for another Lamaze video, you'll find that there is another that offers a lot more detail with a much more exciting and engaging presentation. Lackluster, Uninformative DVD: The presentation and content of this video leaves a lot to be desired. are not professionally done nor are they referred to in a clear manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6035: This video could also really use some visual aids besides Sheri holding up a poor illustration, writing lists (that she doesn't finish) on a whiteboard and the worst...her on the ground, legs spread in high-waisted khakis demonstrating childbirth. Sheri is incredibly condescending when she mimicks pregnant women. There is no laughing in this video...: There's not much learning either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6036: Because I love condescension: If there is one thing that will turn me off to any form of instruction it's condescension. I can't stand being talked down to.There are much better videos out there that treat the viewer as if they are an adult.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6037: The DVD taught us nothing, 80% of this DVD is about Sheri talking about her own life.. Ruined my life..: I'm an expected father to be, and I thought this DVD would help me show my caring compassionate side... While watching it Bayles seemed more intent on belittle the viewer and sharing her own life story then furnishing us with information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6038: : Altough the content on childbirth is descriptive (at times a bit too descriptive), the commentator/director Sheri Bayles is one of the most annoying, irritating, wanna-be-actresses that my husband and I have ever seen. Her approach to teaching by injecting humor is painful, and it took all of our strength to not plug our ears and cover our eyes to watch this woman. If you can handle obnoxious, loud and nerdy instructors, then you may enjoy this DVD.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6039: My wife (a physician) and I cringed through the entire presentation.If you buy this video after reading my review, you deserve to lose your money AND be subjected to Sheri Bayles for over 5 grueling hours. The video quality is horrible as are the 80's rejects posing as her audience. : You could not pick a more annoying instructor than Sheir Bayles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6040: 5 1/2 hours of essential information - and all the things we didn't know we didn't know! : The moment we watched this class, we knew, we didn't have to worry about childbirth anymore. Sheri, thank you for sharing this information in such an easy to understand and humorous way..\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6041: I was pregnant with my second daughter when I bought this DVD trying to avoid taking a Lamaze class and it totally did the trick. I felt better informed and prepared for natural child birth and how to avoid unnecessary interventions. A wonderful purchase: This DVD was a great investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6042: The cover reminds me of Wilson from Castaway...he didn't know much about childbirth either.If you want to pay for only ~10 or so minutes of good information, spend your money. Missing tons of crucial elements: This video/DVD does not thoroughly explore all the elements of Lamaze preparation. There are other products out there on the market that have a much greater wealth of knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6043: The actual INFORMATION in this video could have been condensed into an hour or less- if you cut out all her nonsense.You could learn more in an hour of watching youtube videos and surfing- for free... and you won't have to endure this woman's awful personality and attempts at humor (numerous times SCREAMING into her microphone.) annoying instructor- waste of time: I wish I could give this video 0 stars. It's a 4 hour tirade of this woman trying to be funny.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6044: I ended up fast forwarding through a lot of it only to realize she was still desperately trying for laughs 5 minutes in to one point.I am probably going to purchase another video simply for the fact that her style irks me! I had missed my window of opportunity to be in a class and decided I preferred to be able to watch a video from home anyway. I feel that a lot of time is wasted in this video with theatrics and cheesy humor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6045: The useful information allowed me to make an informed decision for having natural child birth vs medical intervention and delivery (epidural and possible C- section). I had natural child birth and was very pleased to find out that the pain was tolerable without medication and I wasn't hooked up to anything except a Hep lock. Lots of Good Information: I am currently taking a birthing class and it did not cover many areas that this DVD covers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6046: We knew what questions to ask, and what the nurses/doctors meant when they were using their vernacular thanks to these classes. This is a great substitute for the classes at the hospital because you get the same information at a fraction of the cost. Excellent: Our baby is here, and the DVDs prepared us very well for what was in store.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6047: I would recommend this DVD if you can't attend a class or if you just need to save a little money for all the stuff you will need to buy your new baby! It gets the job done: My husband works shift work so attending an actual class week after week wouldn't have worked. I figured the next best idea (and actually cheaper idea) was to get a DVD we could both watch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6048: very informative: I bought this DVD because I didn't want to attend a traditional childbirth class, but still wanted to be informed. I did not find the audio quality, her sense of humor or her accent to be annoying or prohibitive to the learning process as some others seem to have. The instructor gives a lot of good information is a pretty compact amount of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6049: The people are a bit out dated, but so far I've learned a lot and this has been so much more convenient that going to an actual class. : This video was almost like taking a birthing class. Better than taking a class!\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6050: Annoying and condescending: My husband and I couldn't fit a birthing class into our schedule, so upon reviewing our options we decided to buy this dvd. Being that we are a couple with a great sense of humor, and don't like to take anything too seriously, \"laugh and learn\" sounded like the right choice. Although, I have to say that she is quite knowledgeable and if she would stick to the facts and not try so hard to be funny, this would be a worthwhile dvd.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6051: I think you will learn from this DVD everything you need to know for labor. : I read other reviews before buying this DVD and I was aware of what to expect. If you dont mind the jokes and silly faces she makes then buy it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6052: I like that there are five couples in the class, so you still get the worries and questions that other new parents could only provide. But, my midwife really wanted me to get the wealth of knowledge that a child birth class provides. I will say that it held my interest so much that I watched the entire first dvd without stopping!\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6053: I borrowed this dvd from the library and glad I didn't invest money but unfortunately my time. The only time i can tolerate the video is when she was actually serious and informative about childbirth. : Her antics is not very entertaining and very annoying to watch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6054: The woman who presents the information is a little goofy, but there is a lot of helpful information here! Wonderful: This is a wonderful DVD to watch, especially for those who are having their first child. This was MUCH better than the birthing class that we took at our local hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6055: : Sherry's a bit quirky but she has a teaching style that is amazing. We loved this video and learned so much. Invaluable Resource!\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6056: Fantastic if you can't make a live childbirth class: We had signed up for a live childbirth class but then I was put on bed rest and unable to attend. I would highly recommend this DVD as a great alternative to a live class. It is packed full of useful information and actually quite entertaining.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6057: this made me glad that i didn't attend a childbirth class (and bought this instead).i also could have done without the Viacord plug... it's like a commercial took over the ending of the program to spoil it.all things considered, definitely worth watching. could have done without the \"laugh\": very informative, content was well structured, though the instructor is a self-declared \"comedian\" with only a couple people laughing out of obligation. it was painful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6058: : My husband and I decided to buy this when we had to miss the childbirth class we had signed up for at the hospital. I would recommend it to any pregnant women/couples out there looking for a cheaper and more relaxed childbirth class. It was easy to watch, very informative and we appreciated the up-to-date information on labor and childbirth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6059: : My husband and I had signed up for a 4 week childbirth class through our hospital - attended the 1st class and decided we would not be going back. I would definitely recommend this DVD to expectant parents rather than taking an actual class. Yes, some of her jokes were lame and her attempting to be funny gets a little old, but overall it was really a beneficial DVD.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6060: Great DVD for soon-to-be parents with busy schedule: This DVD worked out excellent for my husband and I who don't have a lot of time to go to the traditional classes. Also, the DVD was less money than what the hospital wanted to charge us for enrollment into their classes. We were able to do these classes out of the comfort of our own home, on our time and without the frustration of traffic, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6061: Putting together a DVD class is a great idea but could have been done much better, especially considering the price. Disappointed: I ordered this video because we are living overseas and couldn't find a live class in English. Both my husband and I found the instructor annoying, especially her whiny impressions of women in labor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6062: I had read several books about labor and delivery, etc., and can't say that the video really contained a lot of new information but it brought the information together nicely and made me feel more prepared overall. Good video, not as cheesy as people say: I was very happy with this DVD set (and in fact just ordered the breastfeeding DVD from the same instructor). I also appreciated the fact that the instructor did not spend a lot of time on breathing techniques and did not overly emphasize natural childbirth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6063: Verry happy with this video - 1st time mom here: I am a first time mom and had no idea what I was in for as far as the birthing part goes. I don't have time to take a class so I bought this video. I have learned sooo much and feel very confident now about what to expect at the labor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6064: I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants the benefit of being knowledgeable of labor and delivery, yet is hesitant to join an in-person class. It really put my mind at ease (a lot of the other courses really scared me) and I feel extremely prepared for labor and delivery. Very Educational and Informative: My husband and I purchased this DVD after attempting to attend an in-person childbirthing class....they just weren't for us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6065: This DVD really helped me: My husband and I were unable to find any classes in our area that would work for us, so we purchased this DVD. The nurses at the hospital were all asking me if I had gone to a class and I told them about the DVD. I loved that I could go back to it and watch certain parts over again to refresh my memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6066: While the information on the DVD is helpful and each segment is clear and easy to understand, the instructor presented it in such a way that made extremely painful to watch.The instructor continuously makes annoying jokes, mocks pregnant women and their partners, using the most unfunny and unflattering impersonations imaginable. We opted to get a childbirth video versus attending a class. Watching this woman's attempt stand-up routine was so uncomfortable that we often found ourselves fast forwarding through a lot of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6067: It had so much info that I found so very helpful. I would tell all my friends to buy it. It awnsered all my questions on child birth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6068: : My husband and I did not want to have to take the time or money to attend an actual birthing class. My husband loves the way that Sheri Bayles teaches about child birth. We decided to purchase this video and we are very pleased with the product.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6069: It answers everything you need to know and makes me feel like I know what to expect when the big day comes! I have watched this video over and over by chapters and take notes simply because it's hard to take in so much information at once. What made me happier was to see the couples in Sheri's group get together for a reunion after they had delivered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6070: I would recommend this to anyone who cannot attend childbirth class,does not want to attend classes or a mom that is scared about natural childbirth. After watching this DVD I felt as If I had attended class and I am now more confident and ready to go with only two more weeks to go! It comes with two disc of information.The DVD is of a live class with real people participating in discussions .\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6071: Comprehensive and fun: Sherri's video gives you all the information you need to know about having a baby in a straightforward and easy to understand manner. The video is divided into six \"classes\" that each cover an easily digestible amount of information. My husband and I watched them 2 classes a sitting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6072: : This DVD is a must have for anyone who is going through childbirth...your birthing class may not explain things with this much clarity and detail (I know my didn't). I learned a lot about breathing, and controlling your breath, and although I am not planning on using drugs through labor, I thought her section on medical interventions very useful. Must have!\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6073: good information, but...: A great video for the information it provides, though some of the sections do seem brief. You do have to get past her humor, which can be annoying at times (would be better to have more info and less joking around)\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6074: Rudimentary, though a tad insightful: It seems to attempt to reach out, but overall remains a small personal account of the trials and tribulations of an $8 billion/year industry. Just not professional enough for me to get my undivided attention. It was a worthy attempt, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6075: : First of all, the information in the DVD is very informative but for $50 buck I figured it would show something more than a lady standing in front of a black curtain holding up the same anatomy pictures that are on my doctors wall. Sheri, the instructor, knows what she is talking about but is extremely annoying and shares a lengthy personal story for every point. For every 10 min of information, you get 20 minutes of insight into her personal life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6076: if you are curious check it out at the library.... she spends the 1st half an hour talking about how big babies and small pelvis are to blame for most of the problems in labor...... I am a trained Doula and we should never blame babies or women's bodies for unexpected outcomes in labor. Babies and Women's bodies know what to do and CAN GIVE BIRTH.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6077: Utterly unwatchable - nonstop grating attempts at standup comedy: Incredibly inefficient information delivery. My wife and I tried desperately to watch it but just could not stomach it despite occasional useful bits. Incessant terrible affected attempts at humor and impersonations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6078: Great information: I wasn't able to attend a in person class but I am so glad I bought the DVD to learn about childbirth and what to expect. I fully intend to use the breathing techniques and I learned a lot of information about labor and delivery. I really like I could go at my own pace and watch and re-watch any parts I needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6079: I really felt like I knew everything I needed to know and it completely dispelled all my worries.When it came to the big day... despite complications such as water breaking with no signs of labor, introduction of a drug to induce labor, and the ultimate required c-section, I never broke a sweat. I like being in control of my situations and knowing the right things to pay attention to, I was concerned about my lack of knowledge especially since we were giving birth in Hong Kong and I was worried about a possible language barrier.This DVD made me a self-proclaimed expert.. My wife didn't watch this DVD with me, but I was able to comfort her through the whole process by telling her what to expect next.This is an ABSOLUTE no question about it MUST for a new parent-to-be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6080: BEST Childbirth DVDs ever: These DVDs (I believe she has three or four of them) are not boring, definitely entertaining, and Sheri has a one-of-a-kind sense of humor. She's obviously an advocate of natural childbirth, but I don't feel like she was beating that down your throat through the whole DVD. From the DVD, I didn't get the impression that if I ever said that to her, she would claw out my eyes.\n",
      "\n",

      "Summary for Row 6082: (although i still feel nothing more could have been learned by seeing this actual footage) My husband strongly disagrees. My husband and I found this DVD very informative and easy to follow along. Only thing I would add is more footage of actual birth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6083: not for the modern enpowered mother to be or her husband: I will give her I did learn something while I wasn't being insulted by her gurgle giberish bad jokes. Just when I wasn't scared anymore after reading Ina Mae's guide to Childbirth, this woman made me feel aweful about the impending doom that awaits me. I am saposed to be scared and my husband an unhelpful weenie who can't deal, how can this women do this to the world when we've come so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 6084: We bought this DVD for convenience over attending classes.The information provided in the DVD is helpful. The material could be easily covered in an hour at the most 75 mins.I would not recommend this DVD. Lot of time is wasted in describing the steps: me and my wife are both professionals.\n",

Since the original, more expensive SP version of the tape appears to be in the process of being phased out by the less than artistic-oriented Troma, this is very unfortunate.Please, Troma, give us VHS buyers back a decent quality SP version of this film.And please, Amazon, do include a note in the technical information section when you do carry a VHS tape in EP mode. I have yet to ever see an EP release of a film on video that did not have considerable video noise and very poor color quality.\n",

Unfortunately the film is completely lacking in style as well and Argento seems to have become interested in CGI and treats us to some of the most pointless CGI visuals I have ever seen. My advice is give this film a wide berth... but then it's all a matter of taste and Argento fans will have to see it... Just make sure you rent before buying\n",

Late masterpiece by a brilliant director: The Stendhal Syndrome is definetely one of the finest entries to the oeuvre of Dario Argento and refers strongly to the likes of Alfred Hitchcock.

      "Summary for Row 6096: Horrible DVD Quality, Interesting Movie: Troma should feel ashamed by the horrible quality of this DVD. The other interviews were extremely cheesy as they weren't even done in person -- it was just Dario holding a microphone answering questions that were coming to him over the phone.The movie is quite interesting and better than I expected. It also didn't feel like it was a FULL letterbox version as parts of the opening credits were cut off on the left and right edges.One of the interviews was OK, but it was really an interview all about Argento's 'Phantom of the Opera'.\n",

      "Summary for Row 6097: The Stendhal Syndrome (2-Disc Special Edition): Blue Underground has done another great job with this horror / suspense movie director Argento.Great plot & suspense.The movie's main character is the beautiful and young policewoman Anna Manni (played by Dario Argento's daughter - Asia Argento) who is tracking down a violent serial killer and rapist (played by Thomas Kretschmann). Her new handicap makes it very difficult for her to track down the killer,But she did finally found him .But i found the story a bit fantasy base but common since argento directs no comments.........long live Dario..........

The film alone would rate at least 4 (out of 5 stars) but the Troma DVD is pretty appalling.\n",

The author clearly knows the world, the animals, the plants, the conditions exceptionally well, and only rarely does she really go overboard in the detailing of this information.Although at times the structure is kind of awkward, especially when characters are thinking, it is a fascinating, absorbing and hard-to-put-down book with likeable, understandable characters.I definately recommend this book to everyone.

The music could be described as latin jazz played by musicians with a rock background, or as rock music heavily informed by jazz influences.

Unfortunately, what could have been an interesting and scary film was just plain dumb!I would NOT recommend renting this movie (or even watching it for free once it comes to Cable), let alone paying money for it.

If you can get past that (and all the shameless tie-ins to the NHL franchise Disney once owned) there's some good hockey action and positive messages about sportsmanship, teamwork, believing in yourself and coming to grips with past mistakes. Estevez plays hotshot Minnesota lawyer and former youth hockey star Gordon Bombay, who gets popped for DUI and sentenced to community service.\n",

Looking back on her other albums I found that there were always a few songs that were just so-so compared to the other songs on the album.

I had the pleasure of seeing her perform with a symphony orchestra a few months ago and the songs here were alive and shimmered with orchestral backing -- Bebel herself is sublime. Quiet Nights: Momento is a continuation of Gilbertos bossa nova lineage and the near perfect production shouldn't be minimized.\n",

After her previous releases I thought to myself \"Well it cant get better than this\" and while maybe I can't say she has improved this is still up there with the rest of her releases.Soft vocals over an almost African rhythm that just blend together so well. : Along with Ceu she is one of my favorite Brazilian singers and have to say, bought this one more hoping for the best.\n",

      "Summary for Row 6591: But starting with track 3, Close to You, through til the end, it's consistently strong, varied material, closer in spirit to Bebel's 2nd release, Bebel Gilberto, than Tanto Tempo: more focus on Brazilian music than electronica (though admittedly 'Cade Voce' does recall the insipidness of the opening two tracks). Its flaw is that the first two tracks are the weakest songs on the cd- hard to believe, I know...(and the 2nd track is the supposed 'hit single'). Um Segundo- entirely acoustic and recorded live in a studio in nyc- is one of a handful of standout tracks, reminding me of how much I'd love to be back in Bahia...\n",

A real disappointment: I stumbled upon Bebel at the bookstore with her first album.\n",

Good album: Bebel up to date still remains my favorite female artist. She continues to do what she does best in this album and that's make deep and sensual music.\n",

Big Brother is watching you...: Orwell's 1984 seems to grow increasingly relevant with every passing year.1984 tells the story of Winston Smith, who's job is \"correcting\" historical documents and removing words from the dictionary.

Theirs is a relationship that surprisingly springs amid bleakness and desolation, flowers against all odds, and ultimately wilts under betrayal.Readers will discover that Orwell's objectives are both thoroughly and terrifyingly achieved with a perfectly dystopian ending.\n",

Whether you read Big Brother as Joseph Stalin or Sam Walton and The Party as being representative of a fascist or communistic authoritarian State, the \"truth\" of this novel, that liberty, personal freedom, and the freedom to speak and be understood are ideals that should be treasured and protected in practice.

Whilst the totalitarian governments of `Oceania, Eastasia and Eurasia' depicted by Orwell may seem to have passed (in the majority), his general sense of helplessness, as expressed through both the protagonist Winston, and the oppressive atmosphere, is as relevant today as during the years of the Cold War. 1984's concept of `Big Brother' has passed into everyday use, and the `telescreens' used not just to broadcast, but to watch people, increasingly appear throughout the real-world society in the form of surveillance cameras.\n",

Many, I'm sure, feel that since this is NOT the case today, that Orwell and his book were / are a wast of time.As for me, the more I read this, the more I see how the overall concept of \"Big Brother\" -- i.e., how information is \"cleansed\" to \"protect\" us; how we are teaching technology itself to out-smart, or at least, stay one step ahead of us -- IS, in fact, all-too-real in our lives today!In any case, very intriguing!

A book of prophecy about America: Someone gave me a used copy of this book when I was very young, and it sat on my bookshelf for many years before I read it.

Good if you stick with it: At the mention of 1984, critics will prostrate worshipping Orwell's mastery of metaphors, readers will rejoice at his clarity, and soothsayer's will marvel at his prescience.

As importantly it makes its own forceful statement against the kind of controlled, closed- minded world the Soviets, the Nazis, and now the Islamic Radical Fundamentalists would have us be imprisoned in.

I thought all of the characters were a rip-off, from the young girl to the protagonist to the mean authority figure who tries to \"help\" the protagonist and turns on him in the end.This is a good book, and I like the metaphor, I just felt like the same idea was espoused in a much more gripping fashion in '1984.'

But, like all of the Star Trek movies that came out after the show's finale, this movie is just a longer version of an episode that might have aired on the SciFi network during the show's run.

I couldn't possibly think of another movie with such sheer cinematic buzz, it's cut like an MTV video: blink and you may miss a visual gag.The theme is doozy but interesting -- a slicing of the same reality in time into three perspectives.

It jumps from talking down to people only looking for sex, to praising how easily you can get sex, to talking down to people whom consider religious compatibility important.

Other than naming the thirty colleges, \"Of excellence,\" the book does little to differentiate between the schools. Overall, this guide is useful for listing thirty colleges named on its cover.\n",

      "Summary for Row 8013: Furthermore the book provides little help with putting together an application for each of these schools - something the author could have done given his claim to know these institutions so well. The college descriptions are more like advertorials written by the colleges themselves rathen than objective and independent analysis with pros and cons. Not Good Enough: I did not find this book particularly useful.\n",

      "Summary for Row 8014: Anyone who would be interested in a book titled \"Hidden Ivies\" does not have the sort of personality suited to my school - the name is nothing, the labels are nothing. Throughout my time there, I was surrounded by people who couldn't care less about the name on their diploma, and couldn't care more about the quality of their education. The title disproves its claim: I graduated from one of the schools described in this book, and I was horrified to see it listed on the cover.\n",

Yes, yours may be ok, but here's one more thing: the software that comes with this card is version 7.5, but the current version is 8.5.

Terrible single: Well whats to like about it other than the title track?The radio edit cuts out a big chunk of the outro and some of the intro and the 7\" version keeps a bit of the intro and still cuts out the outro.\n",

Alternating between groaningly, achingly terrible and downright silly, 1999's The Haunting loses its threadbare plot in a special effects quagmire, obliterates any of the greatness it could easily have inherited from this predecessors, fails to make use of the magnificent understated creepiness of the novel, and squanders a talented cast.

Only in the final pages does it become clear that all which has transpired over the generations was foretold as the rise and fall of the Buendia family by the mystical gypsy Maquiliades.

His lyrical prose makes family curses, fortune-tellers, magic carpets and levitation as real and alive as civil wars, passionate and reckless men and women, and banana company plantations.

      "Summary for Row 8716: Also, I don't understand why the movie switched between color and black-and-white -- I'm guessing the decision was made in a very late editing session because it didn't seem to have any context. I encourage you to check your cable listings if you're curious about this movie and spend your money on something better. sticky sweet, predictable...: I am so glad I waited to see this movie on cable.\n",

      "Summary for Row 8717: We were prepared for chics dancing on bars and related craziness, but it was actually a slow-moving story about a country girl who moves to the Big Apple to become a songwriter but is afraid to sing in public. : My roomate bought this dvd, thinking that it would be fun and mindless, along the lines of Bring It On or such. By the end you will be begging her to sing the (explicative deleted) song!\n",

      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 8723: This is a 2 star movie if you're not a girl and under 16: This movie is a pretty boring tale of the surburban girl going to New York and getting her dreams crushed before finally making it to the big time. Again, if I were a 14 year old girl, I would probably like this movie because it was geared towards 12-17 year old girls. Being a 26 year old male, the only thing about this movie that was enjoyable were the nice looking girls.\n",

      "Summary for Row 8724: Coyote Ugly: I usually dont give reviews of movies becuase everyone else does and it sums up what I have to say but I read the reviews for this movie and was very dissapointed. It shows how you should never give up on anything that you really want -boy or girl- becuase it can be acheived. I belive that everyone should see this movie!\n",

She was always making these puppy dog faces like she is saying, \"Look how cute and adorable I am.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 8726: : I thought this film was great, especially as there is a real bar in NY like the one in the film. Coyote Ugly is an excellent film for pretty much everyone to see, and the CD is also good. If you dislike this film, then why are you looking at buying it anyway??\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 8727: That said, I believe the director and editor (more on that later) should be taken to a public place and caned with a bamboo pole.What starts as a cute girl-coming-of-age-in-the-big-city movie begins to fall apart the moment the girl who's too shy to sing in front of anyone starts working in a bar that requires her to dance on the bar while getting buckets of water dumped on her. ?There is a spasmatic sequence with a phone call, a trip to a club, a family reunion and a performance that had to have been spliced together by an MTV editor that drank way too much Mountain Dew while eating pixie sticks. One character even repays a debt that was cut out so she couldn't have even known that she owed it!Hopefully Piper will have better luck with \"Slap Her, She's French\" this year.\n",

Pretty Girls with a thin plot: The movie stars Piper Perabo who is a very likeable actress. Its kind of ironic that the cover of this movie reminds me of a Spice Girls poster.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 8729: The plot is a stupid retread of the \"small town girl goes to the big city\" story ,the producers did'nt even try very hard to make a decent film around all the \"T\" & \"A\".Why would anyone want watch Coyote Ugly at a theatre or buy it on DVD when movies like this can be seen on late night cable seven days a week? Created for the \"Frat Boy\" demographic, Coyote Ugly is packed with scantilly clad hoochies dancing around on bar tops and acting very badly. A waste of plastic and metal....: This is without a doubt the most brainless movie ever made.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 8730: As a result, the different plots running through this feature appear strangely unrelated, maybe because as a viewer one just doesn't get engaged. Don't go there: 'Coyote Ugly' often gets compared to 'Flashdance'and sort of falls in the same genre, but it lacks both the charme and the choreography that made 'Flashdance' a success. Easily one of the worst offerings in the last 12 months, maybe ever.\n",

      "Summary for Row 8734: I can only assume he had a contract with the studio to produce a certain number of movies and this was one of his 'fillers'.An unlikely plot to say the least, the acting was substandard and John Goodman, usually a decent actor, looked embarassed to be associated with this, seemingly hanging about in scenes waiting for his check to clear before he could leave.I've no doubt this movie earns at least 4 stars from many people who use this site; the teenage girl and mid 20's male I'm sure think this is an 'awesome' movie. : You know you're watching a bad movie when your partner leans over to you and, without ever having seen the movie before, outlines the plot in detail, including accurate descriptions of most of the scenes to follow minutes after the opening credits have run.What on earth was Bruckheimer thinkning when he made this? Utter dross; Hollywood really needs a fresh injection of writing talent.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 8737: If I wanted something artistic or meaningful, I would have looked for word \"Miramax\" on the outside of the box - a studio that has made many wonderful movies, but not the type of high impact, SIMPLE fun Jerry Bruckheimer and the late Don Simpson have delivered so well. It's Entertainment, Folks: I am so tired of reading reviews from people who think every movie should be an artistic masterpiece, or at the very least, should have a poignant message. This is one of the most entertaining films my wife and I have seen in a long time, and none of the people involved with its production have anything to apologize for.\n",

      "Summary for Row 8738: Short of a pubescent male, I have to think that anyone who enjoyed this movie is either miguided (hopefully) or an idiot.If this is really what a person looks for in a film, let me recommend saving your money and watching nearly any television sit-com....they're just as bad and it won't cost you four bucks a pop. Howlingly Horrible: This was one of the most embarassingly bad films I've seen in recent memory.I watched this because there is a 14 year old in the house who is understandably amused by girls in their early twenties dancing on top of a bar....and is willing to watch a non-plot for a half-hour between those scenes. That way, people who are dragging the human race intellectually down to such a depth can at least offset the damage they do by hopefully lifting someone else up.\n",

This movie will most likely be a hit with teeny bopper Backstreet Boys fans and junior high school age boys. The bar owner's story would have resulted in a better movie and a less misleading title.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 8740: Coyote Aint So Ugly: Thsi movie delivers with a little of everything, action, romance, and a little something extra for the guys. You should see this movie if your looking for a love story, a little fun for the guys, or a laugh out loud riot, in all i give this flick 4 stars for greatness. Violet, a little town girl, has roamed into the big city in search of her dream.\n",

One of the most unbelievably vapid things I've ever seen: I was trapped on a bus recently, and forced to watch this movie. An excuse to put hot, young Hollywood PG-13 girl flesh all over the screen.\n",

      "Summary for Row 8744: Best songs:Temptation Waits- Seductive.I think I'm Paranoid- Has a pretty dark vibe to it.When I grow up- Being a teenager I really relate to the lyrics.Medication- It does for this album what \"Queer\" did for their first.Special- Catchy.Push it- Interesting lyrics. The songs on this one don't have the same dark edge and I don't think that Shirley's vocals work as well. That being said its still a good album and worth a buy (after you've purchased their first).\n",

After bingeing in the dark, Garbage contrasts with flickers of light on Version 2.0, without losing their intensity or our attention. Their brilliant formula of avant-pop rock with dancefloor beats works all the way without sounding recycled or stale.\n",

      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 8748: Such, direct and bold songs as \"I Think I'm Paranoid\", \"Pust It\", and \"When I Grow Up\" hold a certain power of Guitar and Keyboard combined, and the results are explosive! A band that was overlooked by most now have an album that any Alice in Chains, Nirvana, or Smashing Pumpins fan should not leave on the shelf. A Must-Not-Miss for Alternative/Rock Fans: This album is an unexpected hit from the world of aternative music.\n",

      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 8754: It goes from soft(8&12), to cowboy(11), to payback(5), to angry(7), to head pounding techno(6&9).

      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 8755: I don't always agree with what Shirley has said off the stage but their music is great. The music just rocks and Shirley and the boys are just fantastic. I want to be Shirley Manson!\n",

      "Summary for Row 8758: Every single CD of the four I have of theirs(Garbage, Version 2.0, Special, and Only Happy When it Rains) is to the point where I like every single song they've ever had. \"I think I'm Paranoid\", \"Only Happy When it Rains\", \"Stupid Girl\", and \"13x Forever\"(\"13x Forever\" is only on the \"Special\" Single import from Britain)are in my opinion Garbage's best songs. Garbage is the best band in the entire Sol System.\n",

      "Summary for Row 8760: : Almost every single song on this excellent album is worth 5 stars by itself! There is only about one song that totally does my head in as it is really repetitive, but don't let that put you off!! My personal favourite on the album is 'When I Grow Up'\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 8761: version 2.0-newer, faster, better: after the fanstatic acclaimed debut album, garbage had a rough second album to make.well, version 2.0 is the perfect second album. please listen to this album, that confirms that garbage are one of the best (or why not, the best!) More pop-electronic and yet with the same dark obscure feeling the first album had.shirley's voice is more adaptaded to the songs and they seem to be more a band than they used to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 8762: If you didn't like the first CD( You really sould though) you will feel different about this one. It's different form the first CD though. They have a lighter attitude, with songs like \"When I grow up\" and \"Special\" this band knows how to keep you wanting more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 8763: Sometimes they sound like a new-wave band, sometimes sing the beautiful ballads (\"The Trick Is To Keep Breathing\" or \"You Look So Fine\"), sometimes they sound angry (\"I think I'm Paranoid\"), but all the songs that are here get along really well. The trick is to keep being a child: When some dull reviewer wrote somewhere in some Yugoslav quasi-intellectual pop-rock magazine that the new Garbage album isn't worth a penny, I was really eager to hear it. bands that successfully mix the punk influence with pop melodies and some techno sound.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 8764: I liked it much more that the first CD...: I've enjoyed this CD so much! I think it flows better than the first CD too.Great music!! I bought \"Garbage\" and really liked it.\n",

      "Summary for Row 8767: Any attempt to throw in the odd tune is discarded for some strange attempt at \"art rock\" BORING Garbage is exactly that......: I dont know what many people saw in this album, but i feel a rethink is due for. And the whining of some over privlaged rock stars who obviously feel as though they deserve more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 8768: It's not that it's bad - it's that it's not good, and you'll be better off listening to the first album a hundred times rather than the first fifty times and this one fifty times.My advice to the band? Ditch the Producer: Garbage's first, self-titled, album was extraordinary. There, hopefully, you'll find what you lost in between the first and second albums.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 8769: Although to call it garbage is a bit harsh: Songwriting lacks creativity, almost all straight major chords. There's much better electronica available. Singer has good voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 8770: The lead singer emotes like a tin can and the music is a good reason why grunge is dying. one star: I give this effort one star--for ambition. This album gives us good reason why the band is named GARBAGE.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 8771: Great concept: Rock + Techno + Pop = GREAT ALBUM! I count 9 good tracks, which is a lot better than most albums these days. Skip over #6, #9, #11, and concentrate on the good stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 8772: The entire CD is listenable -- not one track gets skipped on my CD player.

Absolutely Outstanding: I must admit that I'm addicted to \"Version 2.0.\"\n",

      "Summary for Row 8773: As much as I love the whole CD, I do have favorites: I listen to \"When I Grow Up\" and \"Hammering in My Head\" so much I'm bound to wear the CD out! warning: this CD is extremely addictive: All I had ever heard of Garbage were a couple of their music videos until my friends persuaded me to buy this CD. I usually go for music with lighter lyrics, but I've fallen head-over-heels in love with all these songs, even \"Medication\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 8774: \"Special\" (displaying the band's amazing pop sense), \"Push It\" and \"The Trick Is to Keep Breathing\" are the ones I turn the volume up for. Just Great Instead of Excellent: Perhaps it's the thrill of discovery wearing off, or perhaps this album is a half-step below their debut. Nothing horribly new on here - the electronic effects are turned up a tad, and I found there to be fewer catchy songs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 8775: I like them a lot-- one of my fave CDs: I like their first album too, but this one has a more electronic-oriented tracks, my favorite is \"When I Grow Up.\" The even better part is that last fall they were on tour with my favorite band, Lit, and it turned out it was of da hook.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 8776: I bought this cd in hopes that it would be really great but only found satisfaction with four songs out of the rest of the 12 tracks. Three of these four songs are out on the radio anyway. I expected more: I expected a lot more from Garbage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 8777: The first disk was wonderful: every track was great, and you could listen to it forever. I was disappointed: Garbage has great potential, but honestly, I expected something better than this. It doesn't have that many good tracks and you quickly tire of the ones that are.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 8778: Some of my favorite songs on there would be \"Special\" and \"I Think I'm Paranoid\". Garbage-Version 2.0: This is a great album. This is a great CD to travel with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 8779: But this seemed a little happier-especially \"When I grow Up\" and \"Special\"-than the first album. Probably the best song is, well, all of them are great! : This is the best CD I've ever heard!\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 8780: Another Good Piece of Work from a Great Band: An all around good album good album with a good sound, but the disappointment is - is that only the first hlaf of the album is GREAT. The second half is good, but usually after \"Push It\", I hurrily change to the last song before I turn it off. \"Medication\" and \"Hammering in my Head\" are the best songs on the album, but the whole thing is well - worth listenin' too.\n",

      "Summary for Row 8781: With the songs like \"I Think I'm Paranoid\", \"When I Grow Up\", \"Push It\", \"Special\", \"Temptation Waits\", and a slow ballad \"You Look So fine\" they conquered the music world. Temptation Waits...: After a great debut, garbage made an album that made pop world better. Much better than the debut was.Stars: I Think I'm Paranoid, Push It, You Look So Fine\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 8782: This album has a mood-swinging way about it, while the first one was mostly consistant, so you're getting both energetic pop songs and brooding, more rock pieces. The best thing about this album, though, is it's emotional impact-- it plays like a story, and it never fails to move me. One of my all-time favorites: This CD was my introduction to Garbage, and it could be that bias but I think that Version 2.0 is much superior to the debut.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 8784: I overplayed this ALMOST as much as the debut, & even though I like the debut a little more because of the slightly darker tone, I wasn't disappointed with this cd. And just like the 2 slow songs in the debut, the slow tracks 8 & 12 have the same hypnotic effect. Great followup, but I like the debut better: This is now doubt 1 of the best albums of 1998.\n",

      "Summary for Row 8789: And with songs Like \"Special\" and \"Push It\" Shirley Manson embodies the meaning of the phrase \"hell hath no fury like a woman scorned!\" Garbage Is Anything But...: While I only give Blondie 5 stars, Garbage is my next all-time favorite band! Both Garbage albums are 4 stars and I recommend owning both!\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary for Row 8790: If everyone listened to it and heard Shirley speak to them the way she speaks to so many through music, I think everyone would want Shirley to adopt them. More mature look at Garbage: Seven words: \"I want Shirley Manson to adopt me.\"Why? In addition to the radio-friendly \"Push It\" and \"Special\", Garbage shows a similar but more mature scope of musical stylings in this, their sophomore effort following their self-titled debut.\n",

Arthur Aull was routinely used as a classic example of the important role of journalists in developing America by the Journalism School of the University of Missouri.\n",

      "Summary for Row 9998: With a modest amount of effort, it could have been reworked as a compelling autobiographical novel bolstered by its remarkable display of features of midwestern life during the first half of the 20th Century. The book reads like a well-done, fully footnoted college paper, not like a dramatic novel. Interesting Subject; Poor Presentation: You'd be hard-pressed to tell a boring story about about a plucky country newspaper editor who had principles and stuck to 'em.\n",
